0,2,"Progress is slow, I have only half licenses and I've playing since 2019. Waiting times are ridiculously long. 7 days + for a license when you get to level 30+. Ad bonuses are a scam. Only 30% reward on other airlines flights and on licenses they're even worse: only 5min discount. What difference doe..."
1,5,"The game is extraordinarily fun fe things to be considered are , 1.)Should add more levels instead of showing coming soon. 2.)It should haveadvanced graphics. 3.)Weather conditions should be more enhanced with better background sound. 4.) Add more customization for planes like the logo. 5.)Add more ..."
2,4,"The game is so enjoyable. I've been playing it since 2018. However I think you have more work to do. First work on the graphics, add an option to color different aircrafts with logos of airlines. That will make the game more real. Also work on the full flights. They are more enjoyable but we often g..."
3,3,"The game progress is obviously slow. Takes a lot of time to move to a new rank or purchase a new flight. The major bottleneck is that after purchase of a new plane, we get only 2-3 routes to fly and then it gets blocked. Again I have to earn from other airlines. Why can't it be allowed to take free ..."
4,4,"Fun game, great potential! Peoples main problem with this is that you can reach the endgame within 2 hours and not everything is available to you right away. You have to train and perform various simulations and earn your rank and planes. Key word here folks, EARN. Everything is free and available w..."
5,3,"The game is fun to play but it is full of problems that reduce this from 5 to 3. The autopilot on some licenses doesnt work so you end up failing the license. Also, u can only take 2 contracts before having to get a new license, which is not enough. This means its difficult to save up since all your..."
6,2,"Just re-downloaded after a long while and it's no longer enjoyable. Game play is too slow, too many ads and very little actual game playing time possible unless you spend real money to progress. You get perhaps 5 mins at a time with flight missions; take off and get to 900 / 1000ft or to land; no va..."
7,3,"Works well, so you get into it, then by the time you unlock the fourth plane; suddenly no more offers from other airlines, so no more extra money, no more flying. You can only come back every 3 hours to reassign a pilot and do one or two flights if you're lucky. EDIT: still playing but it's one of t..."
8,3,"Really good game but only gets 3 stars as some of the emergencies are ridiculous, for example first engine fails, as nearing runway, the second one fails leaving the plane uncontrollable and leads to an inevitable crash, other than that, really enjoyable game, come on developers, sort the emergencie..."
9,2,Game is good but too much slow. Just on the third plane you have to wait 7-9 days to complete the license then only you can start flying again. Neither if you want to do it shortcut way pay some cash for the game neither keep waiting 7-9 days just to make 4-5 flights. Uninstalling due to the same.
10,4,"It's a good game, great time killer and graphics are great. I only have one issue the game is a little off when it comes to situation missions, the flight path is off from what the map shows and which causes you to fail."
11,4,This game is great. There is amazing graphics and a variety of planes. Even 747 and 737. The controls you can choose the sensitivity. Variety of missions too. I do recommend this game. No lag no glitches. Lovely game.
12,3,"This game has all the workings to be very popular, however it's incredibly difficult to advance to newer airplanes/airports/routes. You'll earn a few thousand per trip but when you realize you'd need to fly the same set of routes over 100 times to just get one new plane makes the game less appealing..."
13,3,I love the game but lately I have been experiencing a problem with the controls. When you start to fly either by taking off or landing the steering wheel is all tilted to the side; basically you have to play the game sideways inorder to obtain a straight profile. It's bloody annoying.
14,2,"You cannot progress quickly if you don't pay money. If you play without topping up your balance, then it's a long way of the same landings and take offs (nothing changes! Really! You even have to turn to the same direction! - work on that, guys! At least rendomize the direction to fly after take off..."
15,5,"Just edited my review ;This game is worth it the levels got me anticipating for more, superb graphics, amazing missions and controls. Would you just consider adding things like checklist like in RFS then I think the building should be made solid, improve on how the airplane crashes, fires etc plus d..."
16,5,"This is a VERY realistic mobile flight simulator. But there are too less routes to open every time after completing a license. That's my only problem with this mobile flight simulator. Overall, 5 stars."
17,2,"This game is just too confusing with the licenses and contracts and all that. Then there's countdowns to fly, and this and that unavailable. I'm just here to fly some planes, not act out a story or whatever."
18,3,"Good game, great graphics, good flight physics, but you have to wait for long periods of maybe 2 or 3 flights a day or buy more money to be able to open new lisences and get new levels."
19,5,"A lot of fun. For one year nearly finished... It isn't easy but have a lot of free flying hours and can understand much better the process of flying. The essential of flying is inside - taxiing, take off and landing. Read a lot of complaints that there aren't full flights. Its true, it is very rare,..."
20,4,"The game is great! There should be many more opportunities to earn money. And also should have more full flights that aren't cut into sections, just put a time advancing button in the game. The games graphics are very nice. The physics are very good. I wish your RFS game controlled like this game. W..."
21,2,"Itd be a fun game if you could play it for more than 20min at a time. You fly 2 missions and then you have to spend game money to unlock extra missions, you have to buy planes and then you have to buy different licenses to fly them. The only way to actually play this game for any length of time is t..."
22,4,Its a wounderful game. The only thing which I want to say here is that price of planes are very very high and it takes very long period of time to unlock/ buy a plane. I would suggest that atleast increase the numbers of contract pilots so that we can earn more money. Thanks
23,3,I am very mad at this game. I earned 4 achievements worth 120 AC credits. I just took 70 Ac credits and purchased licence D then the game told error so it asked me to restart the game. I did and my Ac credits are gone and i didn't get my license. This is a very big problem please fix it soon. If you...
24,1,"This game is full of problems. There are gameplay issues including descent paths and ridiculous flight paths with hairpin turns, loss of connectivity issues, usually after a long full flight, if you navigate away from the game, there is a 50% the app will restart upon coming back to it. Which really..."
25,3,Amazing but the screen thing is annoying why don't you just NOT put that as perma control ? I hope you have an answer for me asking you about why a game that has no visible online features is online only ? Explain and I'll give 5 stars . This is idiotic only because of these problems . One less star...
26,4,"To be honest, this is one of the best, easiest, and most fun flight sim games I've, personally, played. It's not too overly complex but has enough going on that can give you a challenge when there is an emergency or fault. I will say that game progression is a bit on the slow side because you don't ..."
27,1,"This is a v bad app.Pls don't download .it is too complicated.there is a map where you have to choose mission and only unlocked mission can be played.but out of 100 places,which is unlocked it is not indicated. Also the controls are too complicated and we can adjust it too"
28,2,"I'll be flying along when suddenly I'll lose all rudder and elevator control. They will become non responsive... That is until they become overly responsive. I'll recalibrate and it will maybe work for like 2 seconds. Meanwhile, I've been crashing in to trees, buildings, fields, and running off the ..."
29,3,"This is a really great game. Amazing graphics, usually straightforward instructions. The taxiing process is a little irritating, planes waiting at intersections for you to come at it, and then you need to stop. Weather is realistic, even though the emergency simulations could be better. Engine sound..."
30,4,"You can actually lost control of some planes. My 2nd statement : Well If it blacks out at you then update it. My 3rd statement : This app only work If the pilot plays, it even have no instruction of what fuel u are ment to have i. The "" landing without gear with fuel transfering"". My 4th statement :..."
31,4,"This is one of the best airplane simulation games. However, the progress is painfully slow. It literally takes months to earn a new rank. And it doesn't allow to fly a full flight. Just take offs and landings don't make this very realistic. It would also be good if the pilot could actually speak to ..."
32,4,"Love the gameplay though it takes commitment. Only critique I have at the moment is the fact that you cant turn off tbe tips or in game notifications saying that i have no more contracts with the plane or that I have a lending exam, like it just gets in the way"
33,4,"Awesome game to play, really addictive. Just one bug that I would really wish to be fixed: Everytime the game sends a notification,when I click on it,it ought to send me to the game but instead,my screen just goes blank."
34,3,3 star for this reason bcz it's take too much time the players can groth very slowly and waiting time is too much plz solve this and reduce wating time for next flight. It will become a great game. But the players don't have too much patience so plz team work on it. Otherwise it's a great game it wi...
35,4,Great app. But there are random glitches. You may be on a long flight (full flight) and then it may state right before landing that you failed the activity even though you made it through the correct way points. That's very frustrating given that full flights are the only way to gain money at a dece...
36,5,This game is awesome I was searching for relastic flight simulators for 4 months I downloaded this game around 1 week ago and I have unlocked the CRJ900 and level 4 and I love the relastic cockpit and it will be more better if the ground scenery would be more better and I have done many things so ea...
37,3,"Great game but very long winded, I do get annoyed when you get a perfect landing and your slowing down and in the middle of the runway then suddenly it will crash with absolutely no reason just its your fault. Maybe be able to select some short haul flights instead of just taking off and landing and..."
38,4,"The game is great and addictive at first, however as you progress it takes way to long to earn enough money to upgrade. If the game offered more ways to earns for upgrades and some longer flights instead of the same scenarios over and over it would help keep people entertained."
39,1,"App glitches all the time, getting tired of landings and takeoffs, never see full flights and when I do, I will get 90% and then app closes and I lose all progress with no way to recover. I took every other app off of my tablet and disabled everything non essential thing to try and make this app wor..."
40,2,"Should've been called Ad Commander as I've spent more time watching ads than flying, it's tedious as is taxiing but real pilots have to taxi, they don't have to watch ads. I can see me going back to Flight Pilot, it's a simpler simulator but at least you get to spend hours in the air! Update: I'm fi..."
41,4,"Great game,one of the best airplane games if not the best but I have only 3 problems with this game first is in controlls good and ez 2 use but the problem is controlling the analog that is too hard and second problem,why don't u add a freeplay mode to practice and visit some places and Third is gra..."
42,5,Loved the game could of had a few more activities like abort take off hoe come that wasnt there. And why are the targets allways between 600 and 1000 feet surely you can aet the target a bit higher like 20-30 thousand feet. As i say ive nealry Finished it nearly now been playing it over a year and t...
43,2,"It became really boring. I play 5-10 minutes a day, because I have to wait 30 minutes for new missions to appear. Leveling up is too slow. Add some more gameplay, come on! And the take-off missions are ridiculous. Flying at 600 ft? If we can't enjoy full flights, at least add a 30000 ft target at ta..."
44,2,"This game is decent, but so unrewarding. Literally it steals your earned points in 50% of the missions. Gameplay suffers because of repetitive mission designs and endless grinding just to earn again points you already had. For this much grinding it needs to be rewarding, but this game is not! Game h..."
45,3,"Good game, enjoyable game but to get anywhere in the game it take days and days if there was any other way to get to the better aircraft faster would make the game more enjoyable"
46,1,"I am playing but only until i don't find any other good game, License, new aeroplanes are very expensive, need to spend too much time and the surprise things is, they are offering very cheapest flights, ridiculous. I have got 8 aeroplanes and only 3,4 in route and others all on ground, as no other r..."
47,2,"The game is fun... when it let's you fly. More often than not, you'll fly 2 or 3 times, then you have to wait for hours to open new routes, or for other airlines to refresh. Progression is very slow unless you pay lots of money. The concept is good, but the delivery is bad."
48,5,Great game 6 stars for the developer....however have to minus 1 star due to the annoying inconsistent co-pilot with the sun glasses. 1.He keeps on telling way point altitude not reached even though im sure i reached it and confirmed it with autopilot. Maybe the developer can reprogram this and chang...
49,5,"Not liked this game, I loved it...The best aviation game... The only thing is, in full flight activity the real time should be 20 minutes instead of 2 hours... As it consumes so much battery power while playing full flight... Otherwise I'll give them 110/100... 10 points extra for ultimate graphics,..."
50,4,Fun and gets your feet wet..that earns u 4* play time last 5 min then wait or pay to speed up. I wait.. Then i forget about game and days later i come back. Who evers idea that was needs to be fired. Js . you need to keep the player active... Not giving them the option to leave. That is -1* . keep u...
51,1,"It's riddled with bugs and errors. I like the game, but when issues surface, I feel like I'm being scammed. I already purchased resources and it's frustrating when can't open the game. Please fix this."
52,5,"I really think it's a nice game,for me and particularly all avgeeks in general. It's a good way to start the realisation of one's dream to immerse himself or herself into aviation. My thumbs down though is the fact that you are sidelining most airports and mostly African airports.It would be great a..."
53,5,"After completing other airlines flights an error message came "" Synchronisation error. Please try again"" with option either to quit game or restart it resulting in losing benefit for playing that round. To resolve this 1. Cleared cache but no success then 2. Uninstalled and reinstalled game but stil..."
54,5,its good game but your are telleing that use ac credits when no money is there. ok but what happens when no ac credits and money will be not there please add more money when we download this game. that my problem. please fix it. thank you.
55,3,"You need either a lot of money or a lot of patience to play this game. The idea and mechanics are good, but you only get 15 minutes of gameplay scattered through a whole day unless you buy in-game cash to reduce wait times or spend 10 minutes watching ads for 90 seconds of gameplay."
56,1,"Very unrealistic and super easy to play. The physics to this game make absolutely zero sense. A five year old could play this with their eyes closed. I dislike all of the sitting and waiting to simulate flights. I'd rather actually fly them myself. Speaking of which, there aren't even any real fligh..."
57,1,Progress is too slow and purchase credits are to costly and they increased the $ to buy plane. Even after reaching First officer am getting mostly SAAB340 and ATR42. Once in a day if you're fortunate you may get autopilot landing or takeoff otherwise simply boring simple take off and landing. It's l...
58,4,"Gameplay, controls, graphics are all awesome, but the missions are too short, and please add cessna 172 to the garage For the last few months there are no major updates.."
59,4,"Had to spend money. Other offers are still only 3 and as you move up with more planes and pilots they Don't increase in pay. Why do I get flights for 700 and 1200. They should all be 5,6,7,8k. The planes and licenses are astronomical on prices but you make no extra money so you spend a week just try..."
60,5,"This is a great game! Graphics are amazing, emergencies are realistic. Even plane controls are very good for a video game. The levels take long to get. Which is a good thing if you want to experience the get just like a pilot."
61,2,"It's decent simulator and fun game, but the pace for licenses and earning money is set so that you have to make in game purchases (if you want to play for free you get 3-4 short flight, about 3 minutes each, per day)"
62,1,Having enjoyed this game over the last couple of months. Over the last 2 weeks have not been able to load game. Have uninstalled and tried again hoping memory would save but still doesn't load. I am on a Samsung android and asking for help. Why won't it work??
63,5,"I really love playing this game. It does not come across as a page to win, but the option is there. The graphics are good, and the controls to me are way better then most flight sims they have out there. I look forward to new updates with this game to jeep the fun going!!"
64,4,"Hi RORTOS, I noticed that during landing, the rear gear and the front gear maintain same level, it will be more realistic if you make the rear gear lower than the front gear during landing just like in real world also it will be more interesting if ATC voice while giving instructions, Cabin crew/fli..."
65,5,"Great game.... 1) it would be better if cockpit view is introduced in replay of a flight 2) custom flight should be available after some levels 3) more realistic cockpit would be appreciated. Only thing which moves in cockpit is air brakes, throttle and handle. Landing gear indicator, maps etc must ..."
66,3,"I like the game graphics,controls each and every thing but only the problem is that you need to give money for the license and you need to complete lic- ences than only you can unlock more routes . If there would not be anything like this ,this game would be my best plane game . Pls fix this thing"
67,3,Tried this game for a week and never really got anywhere. less than 10 minutes game play a day unless you spend money. Had no idea what was going on or how to select flights. Taking off and landing was great fun but very little game play .
68,3,The game is eh it takes a long time to get new planes and there's NO free flight by the time you get the third plane which took me 2 weeks to get if the game had free flight it'd be ALOT better and I'd rate it 5 stars
69,1,"Advise to new downloader of this app,if you dont have money,your progress will be zero...1st,the app needs data every time and the progress is very slow!The developer,many things you need to adjust; 1:purchase credit is very rare to get...try to increase the amount of credit in every activity to mak..."
70,5,So far this is the best flight simulator I have ever played. The flights and situations are real scenarios. The maps and graphics are awesome. Thank you to the developer of this game. IT'S AWESOME TO PLAY!
71,4,It brings out the need to flight. And it feeds it 99%. This game has what i was looking for. I left out one star since i am just starting to see it through how ever my very first approach was realy amaising thank you for giving it your time.
72,5,"Realistic gameplay, is anything going to appear in the coming soon slot, it has displayed coming soon for a long long time, maybe freeway, full flights take offs."
73,4,"I truly love the experience of playing this game,....truly an amazing airline game,...thank you! Uhm, I noticed several times that the ground brakes actually do work, properly, even though the games tells me that I will have to use maximum reverse thrust when I land because the ground brakes aren't ..."
74,5,"The best flight simulator..however for 100pc flight experience, developers can include cabin controls like lights,seatbelt sign On/Off,pre flight checks,etc available with the pilot."
75,4,"The game isn't like a real flight simulator,that's the down side amongst many, airports are the same all over the world,eg Leeds Bradford is on a hill top but this Leeds Bradford is in a valley near the coast. The plane doesn't respond as good as the real plane does,landing well youve gotta be reall..."
76,4,Very good game graphics are ok controlls are supergood this game also has live cockpit with is amazing but the reason i make it 1 star is because theres no freeflight theres only 3 buttons in the lobby named 1.contract routes(its where you do your missions) 2.airplanes and licenses(where you complet...
77,1,Really great game... But it takes much more time like even 1 or 2 months to complete unlocking new planes and routes.... we have to wait for huge days to juat earn whatever needed... thats not fair . Even the rewards are also very small.... the game is only apply for those who r ready to pay money o...
78,2,"I found this game so interesting but their is one important thing the developer never but in mind. TIME! I have never come a close a game where by you play in REAL TIME. Every mission consumes real time. That is anoying. Image flying a Full Flight, let's say Full flight is 6h 45m. Who will hold thei..."
79,5,"love this game. Been playing it for a while and one of the best simulation games out there. There's just one improvement I would like be done to the game though: it would be better if you could start multiple licenses at the same time. Currently, you can only go for one license at a time and you hav..."
80,2,The game play itself is good but the pay wall is beyond ridiculous. I'd much rather just pay $5-$10 up front and be able to actually play a full game and not have to grind like crazy while also waiting for cool downs.
81,1,Not a bad game to pass time you cannot get passed level 9 without giving your Google account or Facebook account you will just keep losing your rewards don't know why this is as it's a solo game
82,2,I'm a couple hours in and the ads are insane. So far the game is interesting and it feels like mechanics will get more complex and challenging as you progress but the only way to play is by watching tons and tons of ads. Not even a paid version. No thanks
83,1,I play this game 6 month until i become an captain.. My Review to this game.. If you don't have a mony don't download this game Because you need long time to go through the level from training to captain 6 month .. About the grafic and design of the Game i will give 5 star.. About the Game policy i ...
84,5,"Great game but progress is too slow you need to watch ads or pay if you want to increase your progress speed but it is not pay to win, all you need is patience to play this game and you will have fun.."
85,1,"I had given you 5 stars but i have reduced it to 1 star, Loss of connectivity you give very few points and request alot when one wants to buy plane or licence. Very few full flight, full landing or full take off. IS THIS ALL ABOUT SIMPLE LANDING AND SIMPLE TAKE OFF."
86,4,"The missions to assign pilots is not working since today. Whenever I click on it, is shows new version available, download. I haven't got any updates on Playstore and this is one huge way to earn money in the game. Without that it's very hard. I hope you rectify the situation."
87,4,"I've been using this app on my Chromebook for multiple years now. Definitely a fun and somewhat realistic simulator. Sadly, it is not possible to control the plane using an external keyboard instead of the tilt sensor - this would be my fifth star."
88,1,"Pathetic. 1. All her engine planes sound the same. Bad graphics. There are no free flying modes. You work hard making money and buying planes and you can't fly them except landing and take off missions. NO FREE FLYING AND HAVING FUN. 3. You make money buy a certificate, clear the test and get just 2..."
89,1,"can power up but no controle for left or right. little side wind and you crash. touch screen tablet. a shame because first looks are great. [EDIT] 2 years and stil the same issues. tablet mode, keyboard and mouse controle but nothing works. after 1 hours removed the app."
90,2,"Halo sir, I love this game very much. But soo much things that fastest any player. Aircrafts are very costly. Rank up is need long time. I play this game scenes long time but 3rd options is still coming soon. Whan are you give update for this option to open. Airbus A310 cockpit is worng. It has like..."
91,5,I love this game! It's so unique and it is almost not a pay to win and I have an idea could you please make a gamemode that is basicly freeplay That would alow you to go around a Big map where you can complete tasks and even intersept whith other live people this would be amazing!!!
92,4,"I am addicted to this game, but it does get repetitive with the same landings and takeoffs. I think more full flights are needed, but I cannot dedicate 3 hours to a flight, so these need to be maximum 30-40 minutes."
93,3,This game is good but I did many updats and that coming soon is still not there also full flights are less and planes in this game cost very high please fix this game in the next update and if we flare land it will bounce up and licences take very long and if we go to the corner of the runway while ...
94,2,You can not put the gear down when going a little faster. You should have the ability to go around and land again after take off and an engine failure. Used to have the full flight but not anymore. Game is getting worse every after update.
95,5,Great app . A real aircraft simulator but needs some adjustments like there is something like coming soon but I am seeing from past 2 years. So some update needed. At last a good app I mean a better app for simulation
96,1,"When i started play this game i like it and put 5 star But after sometimes i realized that the price of the aircrafts in my app so expensive and deffrent frome my friend So i contacted the developers to fix the glitch i have in my app,they ignored me many times That's why i put 1 star now After all ..."
97,4,"Its a great game, pretty realistic. but wish for more flights to earn money and yeah cant wait for actual flights. Thatd be fun. And could be a bit brighter or something at night would be nice."
98,5,"It is very good, but as u upgrade ur level u are also increasing the difficulty. it is too hard to get money enough to buy larger aircrafts. But it is fantastic game, it will teach u almost everything"
99,3,"Game is good and fun but there is few bad factors . 1- touch sensor for controlling the plane movement is too bad . 2- i can't title my screen upside down to hold my phone better , i am forced to hold the phone in a position where my hand block the phone sound opening ."
100,5,I've always had a dream to be a pilot some day and this app has changed my life. The best thing is you can go up in levels and get to the highest which is airline commander( that is also the name of the game👍). Whoever made this game should get 5 stars whenever someone plays this game. Absolutely b...
101,5,"AMAZING. BEST FLIGHT SIM THERE IS. However, one change I would like is there to be a free play mode, where u fly around wherever u want. Though, still a very fun game! 😃😎🐦"
102,2,"Even though I have enabled the storage permission, app is getting with the reason saying storage permission is not there. I can't continue the game after the level 4. So I planned to uninstall it."
103,3,The cost of the planes are too high. Please reduce the cost of the planes. In offers from other airlines mode I can fly only 3 times at a time. But I have unlocked 4 pilots. Please do something. Elsewhere it is a nice game
104,5,Very good but sometimes have problem while playing it might some bug but the new update promises that it had fixed buges so hope the game will be improved and the time for new activities should be decreased the player has to wait for the time to play so i really request the developer to make changes...
105,4,"The game is quite repetitive but I still enjoy it. However, since the update it does not let me use some functions and, instead, tells me there is an update available. I have reinstalled the game and there is still the same problem."
106,3,"Mostly take off and landing, regardsless of airplanes you have they behave the same. Very little airport to airport flights. All together boring but you can keep it free. Not worth to spend a cent here."
107,4,"A very good game if you sre new to flight sims, the graphics are pretty good considering its a mobile game, it does have in-game purchases and it can be difficult to get new planes but it is still very good."
108,3,I really love the game however... When in full flight and changing heading the game will expect you to align to impossible headings i.e from 17 to 215 back to 10 and round to 300+. It's extremely frustrating as I end up failing the task for not staying aligned. Fix it!
109,5,Back to 5 star. Seems to have corrected itself. Thanks. Nice if the flights were worth a little more. 🙏😂
110,5,"I'm getting an error saying ""I cannot download localisations"". I'm on version 1.3.7. Please fix at the earliest! I just got into being a senior captain! 💔"
111,3,"I injoyed playing this game!! Only giving it 3 stars becouse I had truble with it wanting to save user data and then freezing up till i cenected to wi-fi and then I could play again so I'll be uninstalling soon, please fix the problem!"
112,4,"Good one. . . But limited. Should introduce more modes, especially one where you can freely fly aircrafts for which all licenses are complete. A free fly mode to the airports unlocked is a must."
113,2,I like the game but it's a little time consuming to have to wait to fly or do anything I think it should have longer flights and shorter time in getting better aircrafts as for the 3 hour flights I love them nothing like autopilot..
114,1,"Doesn't start at my phone, before update it was a miraculous game but now it's totally rubbish....admin should take care and should reply back with bug fixing.. downloaded many times but always get stuck at loading package screen"
115,5,"You know it is a very special game for me .But it has a bit problems,I am facing them too .First is currency erning way should be easy .and aircraft controllong should be smoother"
116,4,"Can't play the game! Keep getting messages on ""new data is available"" and pressed restart repeatedly and it doesn't work! It works after uninstalling and reinstalling the game."
117,5,Wonderful flight Sim app easy play great graphics love the camera replay. Would like to see aircrafts put on a more realistic look! When are you guys going to start adding liveries to the planes?
118,4,"Not so bad. Graphics quality is good and the aircrafts are also detailed. But I've found some issues. First of all, you can't progress very quickly. Secondly, if you want to progress, you have to pay money. And finally, there is no 'free flight' mode. Otherwise, good 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍."
119,2,Was working fine and played for soo freakin long and now whenever I try to assign a flight it says a new version is available &amp; restarts the app every time. Please fix because I've wasted too many hours playing this game.
120,3,"Its a good game in general but very costly I worked out it would be cheaper for me to upgrade my pc, download ms flight simulator compared to buying in game credits to help progress the game or collect money the slow way"
121,1,Old game but never change thas so bored. I play this since 2018 i guess but nothing change and it will get harder and harder to earn money.
122,3,Love the gameplay but i can only play it once a day for 10 min max because it doesn't have much routes that i can use. It would be great if a free sandbox type map was also available.
123,5,"This is the best airplane game ever!! when you play it you think you are driving a real airplane because it has evry things a real plane has like terbulence,apu etc.and it also teaches us how to use these things and theplane sometimes also gets in critical conditions like engine failure,sensors fali..."
124,5,Very good game. But still please include the option of flare landing. This will make the game even more better. The plane lands with a very little flare almost on all the three gears.
125,5,If only you could rank a little faster it would be real fun... flying the same altitude almost every route and flight is monotonous a bit more care in the routes and more take offs and I would pay to download this game....
126,5,Like this app a lot. Just wish it would have a free flight mode even with the constant online connection.
127,3,Game controls and graphics are good. But i think game progress is very slow. Everything is locked and require days to unlock main air planes and routes.!
128,5,"""Please update"" issue seems to be fixed and game is working again. It is good game, just one note. Please develope some career/free flight mode and make more end to end full flights. Otherwise it is good."
129,4,Controls are some of the best I've played. I wish that the terrain wasn't all flat though. Hill/mountains would be more realistic.
130,3,Amazing game.. but free flight mode is missing where people can fly their unlocked planes at unlocked routes with no tasks involved.. Downgrading my ratings from 4 to 3 as I m not able to find full flights..
131,1,"If there is nothing change within a few hundred nautical miles in a full flight, why not have a time multiple button 6x or even 20x. You keep torturing the users is a good way to drive them away."
132,1,Spent a lot of time getting all planes and licenses...upgraded phone and have to start over...🤬...sent email to developer and have gotten no response...
133,5,"I dont give it one star, no stars now, playing for weeks and now it says another saved account detected login, wont let me do anything this happend after update, give it five stars whatever was wrong has now been fixed and have lost nothing in game play well done RORTOS"
134,2,The game is good realistic but it is not user friendly it takes lots of time to earn money game should have hard milestone but this is too much please give us a way to level up quickly you all stubborn in levelling up
135,4,Best game ever just some technical problems are there for wexample whenever i am in the game the money the will give me will be 25k and when next time i will come it will decrease/increase. There is another request to rortos that the other game the real flight simulator RFS shoulf be free
136,3,"Game performance, graphics are very good. But one problem is there i.e. Whenever I assigne work to a pilot this shows new version available every time. &amp;When i click on download restart, the problem remains same, Please fix this Thank you"
137,1,The game is made to spend money. It takes too much to progress. And there is a lot of bugs. When you are taxing a plane comes and hits you
138,2,It was nice but the game took a lot time to unlock new places and I played it a long time and I got bored in that game
139,2,"Had to drop my rating. This game is slow in progression, doesn't allow for big money routes and three options to fly for every 30 minutes is becoming boring. Need to update and progress the play for a higher rating."
140,5,"This is the best game I've played all my life, I took 13 months to finish all 83 levels (all airports, airplanes and licenses). From March 2020, I am waiting for updates eagerly. Hope you don't disappoint us.."
141,1,Worst game ever first of all that it is not opening only. I am trying since one hour but is saying loading loading but nothing is happening so please don't download and don't waste your mobile data
142,1,I couldnt connect anymore to the game once I reached a very advanced position. The game doesnt download or open any more.
143,4,"It's a really fun game, I just wish we could free fly, without having to do a route or ""mission"". I just want to fly the planes and do whatever I want."
144,4,It takes too much time to load the data of game and also after playing once it takes 25 minutes to load next mission and this time is too much please make this time shorter so that we can play game for some more time we hardly play5 minutes the game after that it shows next mission in 25 minutes ple...
145,2,I don't understand it keeps on saying new version is available when I try to assign a pilot it's showing a new version of data available but i couldn't find it on Google Play
146,3,its a good game afterall... But there's one thing that disappointed me WAS THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC....IN FULL FLIGHT AFTER TAKING OFF CRUISING THE WAY...IT WOULD POP UP LOADING SCREEN BUT THATS OKAY....THE sad thing is ALL THE REAL TIME TRAFFICS DISAPPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE......AND FREEZED IN THE AUTOPIL...
147,3,"This game is really nice, but the reason as to why l am giving it 3 stars is because it needs internet connection why don't it be offline."
148,2,A great game to start with but then as you progress you slowly begin to see how long it will take to complete without paying for progression. That is the disappointing thing overall.
149,5,This the best game from rortos and very simple and best graphics and controls But please tell me that how I can unlock new routes please tell me. I am unable to unlock routes. Please reply to my answer. And I will give full 5 star rating for this game The best game in the world
150,4,"Game says that there is a new version available, and download it now. But, only gives an option to restart or quit. And have the latest version of it under my apps. Please fix the bug."
151,4,Good but make More easy way to access it is difficult to use and make button option to fly plane announcements od air traffic should be clear
152,3,"The game is good but more coins for licence, flights and has repeated licences and also less duration for completing contracts after obtaining licence. Also the coins obtained from other operators has decreased."
153,2,"Very slow progress report, i have been playing for months and still couldn't experience every air bus, on deck! This game is slow and full of advertisement."
154,3,I am enjoying and loving this game but need some improvements like full flight with take off and ending and I am waiting when Coming Soon box open
155,2,"1. You cannot chnage the pilot name. 2. You cannot go far quickly, you have to stay local for days even weeks before moving to the next plane that costs you a lot of money and to get to that type of money you have to stay local and land and take off at the same airports for minimum. It would be fun ..."
156,3,"Best flight Simulator game...But need more challenges of Full flights mode, enroute weather changes and ATC communication....Game gets a bit slow once u climb up the levels..."
157,5,Amazing game.. but today it says a new version of airline commander is available to download but there is no link available to download the new version.. kindly help fix this issue
158,2,"This is so dumb! Most of the time the game didn't even load, and when it did, I got a 5 hour flight which was so annoying!"
159,4,Just ... Beautiful 👍...still on point ..but ..bugs!! .too much .. please fix this..says there is an update but I checked nothing..I can't issue trips anymore..
160,5,"I like the simulator,but there are few propeller -powered airplanes and no concorde,there should be more updates,add some liveries to the airplanes,the airplanes are just blank"
161,1,"Awesome game, but forces you to spend money advancing to higher levels. As much as I didnt want to, I deleted the game"
162,3,I have this problem now that when I launch the game right after few seconds it says update the game and gives you the option of restart or quit and both times games closes and I don't see any update on play store
163,3,After the recent update game lages a lot twice between in my long flight and it's really getting festreting me and now it's showing new update available and when I check in PS no update here.
164,1,"App won't even load. Just a black screen, First game that couldn't start on my phone. Other games over 2 GB work perfectly fine.."
165,5,Very good game compared to all the others this one takes you on a full long journey in the sky all over the globe
166,1,"This is very excellent game.I know of air every system.This is helpful and mid realistic.But this have two option.next option coming soon. when next option coming.please,say to me.when coming next update."
167,3,"The game good. But unfortunately, from last OS update was not abke to play. Kindly make provision to play game in any OS without interruption."
168,3,Game is awesome. Just add a feature to tell assistant to shut up. Also when installing it says to go through all tutorials.
169,5,I love this game but the planes are very mind blowing prices this Is better to low the price of the planes and licenses are also mindblowing price
170,2,What happened to downloading a game and being able to play without them thinking only revenue and making one wait so long to play unless u pay more money. Game looks cool but u can't play much. Rather buy a console less expensive in the long run. U guys suck
171,5,Very good I have seen this game advertising so many times I was eager to download it but getting through all the licenses is a bit annoying.
172,2,The gameplay is good and graphics is decent but It's pay to play when i tried to get licenses if you didn't spend the more rare currency the game crashes and you have to buy it
173,5,This game is great i love it but pls add more plane's like (Hawker Siddeley HS121 Trident) and (tupolev tu-144) And more locations like (Iran . Canada . Egypt and etc...)
174,3,"I hope there is a bug, sometimes the planes climbs up during landing or it may start fly like jet flight and sometimes it leaves the application without user command"
175,5,Incredible Game I wanted to be an airline pilot but could never be but by playing this game I'm learning something I have treasured for life. It's super fantastic game if you love flying you will really learn from it.
176,4,Hello good game but only one problem is that when you taxing and a other plane your plane will destroy like it's landing gear will destroy but the plane you hitted will not destroy 😞😞😞😞
177,4,It's a good game but when I landed my little aircraft I was going 170km and then the they said perfect landing and then two landing gears broke off and crash
178,4,"It's a good game but I wish they add,like a mode we you can fly any plane and go any airport the game has"
179,3,"Game is getting autmatically restarted, asking to update to new version. Installed version already the latest one and even the play staure does not sgowung any new version for app."
180,4,"Hi friends, Game is really awsome... But slowly it will make you get bore.. But however pilots like this game very very well.... I love this game"
181,1,I spent more than a year playing this game. I got to the level of senior captain and had even unlocked Boeing 787. The game never saved my progress even I tried to link with google play. On updating the game I all my progress got lost. Please help.
182,2,"Can't assign, it shows restart and update but once i restart there is no update, even i have checked in play store too but there's no update. Fix this"
183,5,I love this game I wish you could pay for no ads there's a lot of ads witch make it take a very long time also needs more full flights
184,5,"I like this game.The plains are too realistic.But you should have to add more aircrafts.For example Antonov,Beluga,BelugaXL,BelugaXXL, Beluga Airbus,etc."
185,3,The buttons when I was trying to retract landing gears it was so hard for me to do it I don't whether it's my phone or this game but my phone has no scratches at all
186,5,It is fun high quality and doesn't have a pot of ads it is a very fun game
187,1,Lots of bugs and problems everytime when open the game it stucks at loading screen. I have reinstall the game. I'm tired with this and I'm uninstalling the game sorry.
188,5,I had been playing this from 5 years 2.5 years from mom's phone and the rsst bym my phone. BTW it has many problems like less mo ey and uc abd licescense and sometimes aske money for unlocking licescense and planes and takes very much times to log in sometimes
189,3,It is a really good game with good graphics the reason i gave it a 3 star is because getting the licences are expensive to get and every time i update the game the price of the licences get higher and higher i hope they fix that problem
190,4,This is a good game and all exept its extremely unrealistic and boring also the screen doesn't rotate which makes it really difficult to play
191,4,Why is it everytime saying that a new version is available? It is saying again and again to restart. Why is this happening? Please fix this
192,4,High graphics game . I really enjoyed it but there will real liveries of airplanes to would make the game better than any games !!!
193,5,All that progress lost! It's on the login loop and always ask to login even though I'm logged in in Google Play.
194,3,Why am I not getting any offers from airlines nowadays? It will be better if the rudder controls are always visible.
195,5,Great Experience and Graphics. Please add more flights and full takeoff and landing in a single objective.
196,5,The game is great I'm all ready captain but I do have something to say when is this coming soon will have a date and can you make it where nothing keeping from making cash on my route with out stoping even if I have to get my linces I should not have to be stopped on it ok thank you
